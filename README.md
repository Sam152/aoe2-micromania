# AOE2 MicroMania

This project is an implementation of a tiny subset of [Age of Empires II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II) gameplay, written in TypeScript
inspired by the classic scenario [MicroMania](https://www.voobly.com/gamemods/mod/475/MicroMania).

Implemented features include:

* Single player and multiplayer
* Attack move
* Formations
* Shift-queue
* Isometric map with terrain
* Configurable hotkeys
* Lobby system
* Recorded games
* Spectating

## Demos

* [Static demo](https://micromania-aoe2.github.io/) (no server component)
* [Live demo](https://main-bvxea6i-5gx6ejvclv6ua.au.platformsh.site/) (running server but may go offline)

## Architecture

The goal of this project is to create a new implementation of an extremely small subset
of features provided by the genie engine. It uses the [smx file format](https://github.com/Sam152/genie-smx)
for assets and attempts to implement concepts like: attack frame delay, range, reload time, min/max range -
available in the original engine.

The entire game state is represented as a single object. Any changes to the game state are made by mutating it
with an action. The most frequently dispatched action is a "tick", which increments the game simulation.

### Networking

The orchestration of state can happen locally for single player or be coordinated by the server. The server
will receive actions that clients wish to dispatch, validate them and send them back to each connected client
to run against their own local simulation.

This keeps all clients in sync, since even for their own actions
they must wait for the action received by the server to commit them to the simulation (ie the order of actions
relative to ticks is the same for all clients).
